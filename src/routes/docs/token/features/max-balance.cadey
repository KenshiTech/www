[heading Adjustable Max Balances]

There's a limit on how many tokens an account can hold. This limit increases
as the market cap of the token goes up.

[heading :size 2 Why is this good?]

Kenshi is a utility token and the goal is to provide services to the users.
The max balance mechanism allows Kenshi to reach more possible users by preventing
accounts from buying the token and piling it up instead.
