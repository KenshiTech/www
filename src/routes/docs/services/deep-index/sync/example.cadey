[table

  [:row    Chain                  [: BNB Chain]   [: Kenshi smart contract is deployed to the BNB Chain.]]
  [:row    [: Starting block]     17633890        [: Kenshi smart contract is deployed at block number 17633890.]]
  [:row    [: Contract address]
           [: 0x42f9c5a27a2647a64f7D3d58d8f896C60a727b0f]
           [: This is the Kenshi token smart contract address]]
  [:row    [: Contract ABI]
           [:[ "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)" ]:]
           [: Human-Readable ABI including only the Transfer event ABI]]
  [:row    Duration               1               [: Run this sync task for 1 month]]
